# <p align=center> Evaluating the Claim that Rising Ocean Temperatures Are Responsible for Rising Atmospheric Temperatures </p>
## <p align=center> By: Kristen Arnold </p>

<p align=justify> The author claims that ocean temperatures are rising, which is in turn causing atmospheric temperatures to rise–not the other way around (Rotter, 2021). The article refers to evidence that sea surface temperatures have been rising since early 1900, long before carbon emissions would have had an effect on our ocean temperatures and climate. The main reasoning provided is that the heat capacity of our oceans is much greater than that of our air, which would mean that it is the ocean driving climate rather than the atmosphere. This article is of particular interest to me because one of my greatest climate change-related concerns is the detrimental effects of warming ocean temperatures on oceanic ecosystems, food webs, and biodiversity. Understanding the root cause of ocean warming is critical to addressing the problem. </p>

<p align=justify> The purpose of this article is to provide an opinion that is contrary to the popular belief that greenhouse gases are largely responsible for the ocean’s warming temperatures. The simplicity of the article makes it relatively effective in pushing this point, as the authors present their ideas using minimal jargon and supplements their points with intriguing graphs. However, information available online about the author hinders their credibility. Their Twitter, @crotter8, projects biased opinions and beliefs; there are numerous pro-Trump, anti-AOC and anti-Greta Thunberg tweets, which may lend insight to the limited credibility of his work as he supports individuals who quite literally do not believed in climate change and attacks those who do (Twitter, 2021).   </p>

<p align=justify> The reliability of the presented claim is also quite restricted, as the author does not cite any peer-reviewed journals or scientific papers to back up their claim. However, the author does reference multiple datasets; namely, HADSST3 global sea surface temp (however, it is from a website called WoodForTrees.org–this site contains credits for data sources, but the referenced dataset is not listed for credit). This data is depicted in a graph that the author draws various conclusions from, so for these conclusions to be reliable, it would be greatly beneficial for the dataset to be accessible and cited. The general trends in global ocean temperature are accurate (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2016). However, published research disagrees with the claim being made, and while ocean heat release may be a factor in the temperature rise seen from 1900 to 1940, other external forces such as greenhouse gas increase, reduction in stratospheric aerosols from volcanic activity and cloud change, are all likely contributors to this trend (Hegerl et al., 2018, p.20). Other models suggest that these external forcings contribute less than 20% to the mean warming of the early 20th century, while 50% of the global warming is caused by an increase in well-mixed greenhouse gases; namely, C<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O (Egorova et al., 2018). The author is correct in his claim that the ocean has a much greater heat capacity than the atmosphere; however, the author failed to discuss the atmospheric increase in temperature during this same time period. The early 20th century warming was by no means isolated to oceanic warming, as the warming between the ocean and atmosphere is largely intertwined, and the causes of the Early Twentieth Century Warming (ETCW) period are still largely up for debate. There were simply too many climate-altering events that occurred during this period to attribute the warming period solely to rising ocean temperatures (and the author also fails to expand on confounding variables that may impact the relationship in question). The author fails to support their theory with rigorous, credible research and fails to acknowledge the limitations within the currently available scientific literature. </p>
